## OpenWAR
### An open-source system for computing Wins Above Replacement

This package is designed to present a reference implementation of Wins Above Replacement for Major League Baseball players. 

#### Installation

The **Sxslt** package is required in order to download new game data from MLBAM. This package is not present on CRAN. Hence, some manual installation may be necessary. The following command:

```{r}
install.packages("Sxslt", repos = "http://www.omegahat.org/R", type = "source")
```
should do the trick.

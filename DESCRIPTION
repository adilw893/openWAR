Description: There are two primary purposes this package serves: 1) it
    facilitates the computation of openWAR, a fully open-source implementation of
    Wins Above Replacement (WAR) that could serve as a reference implementation
    for the sabermetric community; and 2) it downloads raw XML files from the
    MLBAM GameDay web application and processes them into play-by-play data in a
    tabular format. This play-by-play information is similar in spirit, though not
    in syntax, to play-by-play data made available by Retrosheet. Those interested
    in the modeling choices that we have made in our computation of openWAR
    should consult our JQAS or arXiv paper on that subject. This implementation
    of openWAR includes functions for constructing interval estimates of WAR for
    each player, as well as comparing openWAR point estimates to those of Baseball-
    Reference.com's rWAR.
